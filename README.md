# Big-Data-Analytics---Classification-Models

This project was from STA4724 - Big Data Analytics. Here, data is given about different types of cars. A categorical variable is made, where if the mpg of a car is above the median, the categorical variable will be assigned a 1. Else, it will get a 0. The data is split into the testing and training group. The training group was used to build the models, and the testing data is used to calculate the testing error. Linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, logistic regression, and K-nearest neighbors were used to predict the classification of if the mpg of a car is above or below the sample median. The testing error, or the percentage of incorrect predictions, was calculated using the testing data.
